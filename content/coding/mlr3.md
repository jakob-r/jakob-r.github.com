Co-author of the successor of *mlr*. 
I contributed to the early development and new object-oriented design of *mlr3*.
The *mlr3verse* consist of various R packages that are developed in a big team across universities.
I largely commit on doing code-reviews and helping others to contribute to the project.
My main contributions are to the packages related to tuning [mlr3tuning](https://mlr3tuning.mlr-org.com/), [bbotk](https://bbotk.mlr-org.com/) and [mlr3mbo](https://mlr3mbo.mlr-org.com/).
