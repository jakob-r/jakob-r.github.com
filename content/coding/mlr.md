Co-author of the widely used machine learning library for R that includes over 80 classification methods and over 50 regression methods. *mlr* also offers hyperparameter optimization, as well as pre- and post-processing methods. I implemented many learners, Bayesian optimization for tuning, fixed various bugs, took care of unit tests, documentation and code-reviews.
