<!--

This page represents the landing page for "projects" section. It is also shown under the homepage header for "projects". It should be therefore relatively short and sweet.

IN the dfault theme, "projects" is divided among "Creations" you authored and "contributions" made to others projects.

-->
This section contains some selected open source projects. You can find most of my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jakob-r/).
