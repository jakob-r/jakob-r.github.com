With this small side-project I simplified hyperparameter tuning within *mlr* by defining a heuristic that choses the appropriate search space and optimizer for a given machine learning algorithm and dataset. More details in my blog post on [r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/07/parameter-tuning-with-mlrhyperopt/) and [my talk](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/mlrHyperopt-Effortless-and-collaborative-hyperparameter-optimization-experiments) at the international useR! conference 2017.
