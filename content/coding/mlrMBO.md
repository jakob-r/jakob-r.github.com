Maintainer and co-author of the model-based optimization toolkit for R: *mlrMBO*.
This R package offers various Bayesian optimization methods and includes parallelization as well as multi-criteria optimization.
Most of my research is implemented in this package and partly resides in development-branches.
You can see my presentation of *mlrMBO* at the useR! conference 2016 in Stanford [here](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/mlrMBO-A-Toolbox-for-Model-Based-Optimization-of-Expensive-Black-Box-Functions).
