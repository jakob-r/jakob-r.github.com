title: Keep data.frame a data.frame
tags : [r-tip]

When writing *R* functions always remind yourself to think about if it can happen that you accidentally just select one column of a  `data.frame`. 
This will result in vector which might not be what you expect in the following code.
One good practice is to always use `drop=FALSE` when you intend to get a `data.frame` and use the `[[]]` notation if you expect a vector.

{% highlight r %}
df = data.frame(a = 1:3, b = letters[1:3])
cols = c("a")
{% endhighlight %}
Lets assume cols is a vector which only sometimes has the length one, then we would do the following:

{% highlight r %}
df[, cols, drop=FALSE]
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##   a
## 1 1
## 2 2
## 3 3
{% endhighlight %}
And to purposefully select a vector:
df[[cols[1]]]
```
