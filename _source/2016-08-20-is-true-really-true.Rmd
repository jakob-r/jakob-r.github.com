Sometimes generating figures with `tikz` can be troublesome and take a lot of time.
Inkscape is a good alternative to generate vector based graphics.
In this post I want to show how use Inkscape to generate a a animated (meaning usage of overlays) slide in the beamer class.

First we need a SVG File with multiple layers generated in Inkscape.
