As i spent quite a few time 
There is a *r* package which makes *classification* and *regression* tasks really easy.
How easy? Realy easy, or how fast can you do a 10-fold cross validation in *R*?

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(mlr)
tsk = makeClassifTask(id="cl.test", data=iris, target="Species")
res = resample(learner=makeLearner("classif.lda"), task=tsk, resampling=makeResampleDesc(method="CV"))
```
```{r}
c(res$aggr, sd=sd(res$measures.test$mmce))
```

I have to admit that it is developed at my department and I might be biased but it is relly neat.
The instructions on how to install **mlr** can be found on [the github page](https://github.com/berndbischl/mlr).
There are also a lot of [tutorials](https://github.com/berndbischl/mlr/blob/master/doc/knitted/tutorial/index.md) giving a good introduction and explaining most of the vast capabilities of **mlr**.
