      <title>Model-based Optimization with Concept Drifts</title>
      <link>https://jakob-r.de/publications/richter_2020_model/</link>

      <description>This paper shows an straight-forward approach on how to apply Model-based optimization (Bayesian optimization) on problems that change systematically over time. This approach could be used to optimize the hyperparameters of an online machine learning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Model-based optimization of subgroup weights for survival analysis</title>
      <link>https://jakob-r.de/publications/richter_2019_model/</link>

      <description>This paper successfully applied model-based optimization to identify optimal subgroup weights for survival prediction with high-dimensional genetic covariates. When predicting survival for a specific subgroup it can be beneficial to combine the training data with other subgroups to obtain a better model.</description>

      <title>mlrMBO: A modular framework for model-based optimization of expensive black-box functions</title>
      <link>https://jakob-r.de/publications/bischl_2017_mlrmbo/</link>

      <description>This is the accompanying paper for the mlrMBO R package. It gives a brief introduction the model-based optimization algorithm and shows that mlrMBO is able to outperform other optimization packages on synthetic test functions as well as on real hyperparameter optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Faster model-based optimization through resource-aware scheduling strategies</title>
      <link>https://jakob-r.de/publications/richter_2016_faster/</link>

      <description>This paper shows one way to parallelize model-based optimization on the example of tuning a SVM. The challenge of heterogeneous runtimes that can cause unused CPU resources is tackled by using scheduling strategies on predicted runtimes. We were able use the resources more efficiently which led to better tuning results. We improved our scheduling strategy in the follow up paper Rambo: Resource-aware model-based optimization with scheduling for heterogeneous runtimes and a comparison with asynchronous model-based optimization.</description>

      <title>Model-based Hyperparameter Optimization for Machine Learning Algorithms on Large Datasets</title>
      <link>https://jakob-r.de/publications/richter_2015_ma/</link>

      <description>In my master thesis I developed model-based approach to multi-fidelity optimization. This approach allows to find promising hyperparameter configurations faster by evaluating the ml algorithm on small samples of the data.</description>

      <title>Analysing geo data on a street level performedon an example of road accidents in London</title>

      <guid>https://jakob-r.de/publications/richter_2013_ba/</guid>
      <description>In my bachelor thesis I developed an algorithm that was able to map observations that were given by latitude and longitude data to the according street segment. This yields a much more insightful visualization that a normal heat-map or individual points.</description>

      <description>Co-author of the widely used machine learning library for R that includes over 80 classification methods and over 50 regression methods. mlr also offers hyperparameter optimization, as well as pre- and post-processing methods. I implemented many learners, Bayesian optimization for tuning, fixed various bugs, took care of unit tests, documentation and code-reviews.</description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>
      <link>https://jakob-r.de/blog/force-ssl/</link>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>

      <title>mlr3 and mlr3verse</title>
      <link>https://jakob-r.de/coding/mlr3/</link>

      <guid>https://jakob-r.de/coding/mlr3/</guid>
      <description>Co-author of the successor of mlr. I contributed to the early development and new object-oriented design of mlr3. The mlr3verse consist of various R packages that are developed in a big team across universities. I largely commit on doing code-reviews and helping others to contribute to the project. My main contributions are to the packages related to tuning mlr3tuning, bbotk and mlr3mbo.</description>

      <title>mlrHyperopt</title>

      <guid>https://jakob-r.de/coding/mlr3hyperopt/</guid>
      <description>With this small side-project I simplified hyperparameter tuning within mlr by defining a heurisitc that choses the appropriate search space and optimizer for a given machine learning algorithm and dataset. More details in my blog post on r-bloggers and my talk at the international useR! conference 2017.</description>

      <guid>https://jakob-r.de/coding/mlrmbo/</guid>
      <description>Maintainer and co-author of the model-based optimization toolkit for R: mlrMBO. This R package offers various Bayesian optimization methods and includes parallelization as well as multi-criteria optimization. Most of my research is implemented in this package and partly resides in development-branches. You can see my presentation of mlrMBO at the useR! conference 2016 in Stanford here.</description>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;JSON&amp;#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
